public class IntermediateOperations {

//    Intermediate Operations: These operations transform a stream into another stream. They are lazy, meaning they are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked.
//    Intermediate operations include:

//    filter(Predicate): Filters elements based on a predicate.
//    map(Function): Transforms elements using a function.
//    flatMap(Function): Transforms each element into a stream and then flattens the streams into one.
//    distinct(): Removes duplicate elements.
//    sorted(): Sorts elements in natural order or using a comparator.
//    peek(Consumer): Performs an action for each element without modifying the stream.
